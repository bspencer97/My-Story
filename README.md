My Story is a storyboarding app that is designed to keep creative assets together for stories, characters, and settings. 
This allows one to keep track of different aspects of their story and reuse them for future projects. 

The specific assets are stories, characters, and worlds. 
For example, one could have an idea for a book. They could then create a story with the title and summary of their idea. 
Characters can be created and added to the story. They can also create the world that the story takes place in. 
Extensive details can be added to give one a comprehensive description of their characters and such. 
The created characters and worlds can be reused for other stories as well.
